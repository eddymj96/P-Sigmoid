P-Sigmoid strives to create a software infrastructure for control algorithms and dynamic simulations. To segment simulations into Logic, Dynamic Environment, Visualisation and Algorithm Comparison and Rankings; a completely modular approach to test your dynamic models and AI/control/optimisation algorithms providing valid comparisons of computational efficiency and objective performance.
